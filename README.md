After cloning...

`bundle` to install gems

`rake db:setup`, which will execute:
`rake db:create` to create the database
`rake db:schema:load` to load schema.rb 
`rake db:seed` to load seeds.rb

If one is created, delete the application.css file in the app/assets/stylesheets
folder.  It will interfere with application.scss.
